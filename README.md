# Time (Stopwatch)

This is a fun project made to test 2D rendering with [notan](https://crates.io/crates/notan).

Everything is tested on Mac OS and `rustc` 1.83.0 (90b35a623 2024-11-26).

In order to build this project. You need to have following packages installed on your system:

* `cmake`

ToDo:

* Display current time.
* Timer (Stopwatch).
* Use random image variant for every number at render time.
* Load images dynamically.
* Render it in the browser (WASM).
* Maybe as optimization not render so rapidly?
